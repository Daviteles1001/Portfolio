    "about my": "My name is Davi de Souza, and I am a Full Stack programmer. For as long as I can remember, I have been fascinated by technology and the art of creating software. Making decisions that directly impact people's lives is what motivates me every day. As a Full Stack programmer, my world revolves around versatility. I work both on the visible part of the applications, the front-end, and behind the scenes, on the back-end, taking care of all the logic and data management. It's a constant challenge, but it's a challenge that I embrace with enthusiasm. I have a range of programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat I am constantly committed to learning: JavaScript, Python, Ruby, among others. Additionally, I am familiar with essential web technologies such as HTML and CSS, popular frameworks such as React, Angular and Django. After all, user experience is crucial, and I make it a point to ensure that the apps and websites I build not only work flawlessly, but are also enjoyable to use. My passion for what I do is reflected in the attention I pay to detail. I believe the difference is in the small things, and that's why I strive to make each project the best it can be. In addition to technical skills, I also understand the importance of team communication. Translating complex technical concepts into understandable words is a skill I've cultivated over the years, and it allows me to collaborate effectively with teammates and stakeholders. The search for improvement is a constant in my career. I'm always up to date with the latest trends in technology, I participate in conferences, courses and developer communities, and I don't hesitate to share what I learn with others. In the world of Full Stack programming, I see my name as an emblem of dedication and achievements. The future is bright, and I look forward to continuing to progress in my career. With me at the helm, we can expect great achievements and innovations in technology."
